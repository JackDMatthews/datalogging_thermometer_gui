todo:
-implement serial reading
-serial exceptions (pop-up)
-cosmetics (icon, app name)


known issues:
-If a channel has no input at a given point, the line for that channel will not be plotted after that time
-Once port is selected, selecting another port will not change. A fix for this should be implemented
-newline character may be different on real device, my laptop uses /r, but it may be /n
